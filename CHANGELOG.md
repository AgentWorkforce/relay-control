# Changelog

Notable changes to the self-hosted control plane. Dates and versions are
assigned at release.

## Unreleased

- Hosted MCP OAuth connectors are now **on by default**. Set
  `SELFHOST_MCP_OAUTH=off` (or `false`/`0`) to disable them; `on`/`true`/`1`
  enable them explicitly, and any other spelling stops start-up.
  `SELFHOST_MCP_EVENTS` and `SELFHOST_MCP_EVENTS_PUMP` stay off by default and
  accept the same spellings. See [docs/mcp-oauth.md](docs/mcp-oauth.md).
- **Upgrade note:** installs that relied on MCP OAuth being implicitly off must
  now set `SELFHOST_MCP_OAUTH=off`.
- New unavailable mode: a partial or invalid OIDC key set, or a public URL that
  cannot be an OAuth issuer, no longer stops the server. Every OAuth route
  answers `501 {"error":"mcp_oauth_unavailable","reason":...}` (reasons
  `oidc_signing_key`, `public_url`), `mcp_at_` bearers are refused with `401`,
  no cleanup worker starts and the reason is logged once at start-up.
- Connector cleanup no longer holds tenant locks across Relaycast calls,
  retries with exponential backoff (15 s doubling, capped at one hour), and
  completes records that retrying cannot fix. Migration 0032 adds the retry
  columns. The operator-only
  `POST /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/mcp-oauth/abandon-cleanup`
  abandons cleanup that can never finish (audit action
  `mcp_oauth.cleanup_abandoned`); live connections must still be disconnected
  before the workspace can be deleted.
